CIDL -- Comprehensive and Intuitive Introduction to Deep Learning

## WHY

Wouldn't it be great if there was an intuitive and digestible way to learn both the *depth* and *breadth* of AI? Too often, AI looks like magic from the outside -- but it’s not magic, it's a clever method. Engineers especially need to see behind the curtain. Once we understand *why* and *how* the magic works, we're no longer just admiring the illusion, we're learning the craft, ready to design and perform our own. That's the goal of my CIDL webseries.

## BACKGROUND

Learning AI, however, is not easy. Topics are highly technical and cover a variety of fields without offering an intuitive or clear entry point for someone new to the field. Most tutorials focus on heavy math, making them inaccessible to most people; or treat topics only superficially; or cover concepts in a bespoke way without tying them together clearly. 

This started as an experiment: Can we teach both the **breadth** and **depth** of AI in a way that’s both **intuitive** and **accessible**? AI is a complex, technical field -- but too often, that complexity becomes a barrier. There's a kind of elitism at play, where ideas are presented in ways that feel needlessly complicated and exclusive. My aim was to make AI education more inclusive -- to break down the field in a clear, structured, and comprehensive way. The goal isn’t just to simplify, but to deepen understanding -- helping more people grasp the fundamentals of AI in a meaningful, lasting way -- far beyond a surface-level understanding.
